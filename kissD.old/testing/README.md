# Testing repository

This repository is not enabled by default and contains packages currently in testing. This includes fundamental packages which require testing before they can be safely moved to the other repositories.

## Enabling `testing`

```sh
export KISS_PATH=$KISS_PATH:/var/db/kiss/repo/testing
```

This can be permanently set in `/etc/profile.d/kiss_path.sh`.
